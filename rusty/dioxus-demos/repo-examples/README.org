just run some examples in the repo.


** Clock

#+begin_src shell
  cargo run --example clock
#+end_src

run a clock app.

except the css I don't know. the rust code:

1. use_signal accept some closure and return a value.
2. use_future move and async move the millis inside some runtime I guess.
3. the loop inside set the millis with new value
4. ~rsx!~ rendor the time value, which updating inside the loop

** Calcular

#+begin_src shell
  cargo run --example calculator
#+end_src

~handle_key_down_event~ handle the event's key. Also a closure function. using with ~onkeydown~.

a lot ~onclick~, also closure with side effect with ~val~. Very interesting ownship magic.
